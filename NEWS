amsReliability v0.10.1 (Release date: 2017-01-11)
==============

Changes:
* Fix bug in TDDB chart when several areas are available. Avoid calculation of models for non existant series (Stress/Temp/area).


amsReliability v0.10 (Release date: 2016-02-24)
==============

Changes:
* GUI available to select the analysis to perform. Options are available using the GUI.
* Auto-update function is available using the GUI. 
* Major code cleanup in the graphics librairy for reusability accross charts type (probability vs degradation charts). 
* Graphic function accepts the column to be displayed as arguments. Allows various names to be used as legend title.
* Exportfile creating is handle in a clever way. Function will match available files, to produce an exportfile if only the degradation or the TCR file was selected.
* Passing a empty file as argument will more crash the analysis. Conditions without fails are dropped.
* Censors are handled correctly. Fails with a higher TTF than a nonfailed sample will not be displayed/considered in analysis. 
* Fit results now display more information (log likelyhood ratio, AIC and BIC) in order to help comparing models.


amsReliability v0.9.1 (Release date: 2016-02-02)
==============

Changes:
* GUI available to select files to be analyzed. 
* Major code cleanup for enhanced readability and maintainability. 

amsReliability v0.9 (Release date: 2016-01-13)
==============

Changes:
* Various OxideTDDB bugs have been corrected. Data status is now correctly read. 
* Bug in Mira exportfile creation have been solved (unfinished samples are now detected)
* Conditions were no valid samples are found are no more displayed on charts.
* Conditions are sorted properly by increasing current/voltage value.
* Chart enhancement: minimal of 3 decades are always displayed.
* Minor grid lines are now displayed on the log scale.
* Confidence intervals have been corrected (Kaplan Maier style). They are now displayed correctly on a Weibull scale.
* Major code cleanup for enhanced readability and maintainability. 

amsReliability v0.8 (Release date: 2015-11-10)
==============

Changes:
* OxideTDDB function is introduced for TDDB data modelization. 
* Handle modelization crash. Data are only displayed and modelized with standard lognomal or Weibull distributions. Parameters are returned to users.
* Better exception handling in case an important file is not found on the network. The script no longer crash. Instead it finishes with a description message for the user.  

amsReliability v0.7 (Release date: 2015-10-30)
==============

Changes:
* Handle modelization crash. Data are only displayed and not modelized if not enough experimental conditions are provided.
* Generic function to create all the exportfiles: CreateExportFiles.
* BlackAnalysis can handle cases where several devices are mixed in the conditions. One analysis for each device is performed.

amsReliability v0.6 (Release date: 2015-10-27)
==============

Changes:
* Conditions splitted in different files are now handled as one single condition (merge before probability calculation).
* Better documentation system. Each function has its own MAN page.
* Fit results are exported to a fit.txt file.
* Massive code cleanup to simplify maintenance and enhance performance (less if/else conditions)

amsReliability v0.5 (Release date: 2015-10-21)
==============

Changes:
* In CreateExportFile.EM function, ForceOverWrite option has been removed.
* If an existent exportfile is detected, user is asked if he wants to keep it, to replace it or to merge the data.

amsReliability v0.4.1 (Release date: 2015-10-19)
==============

Changes:

* Creation of exportfiles supports experiments with several conditions (ACE equipment).
* ForceOverWrite option was added to the CreateExportFile.EM function to force the replacement of existing exportfiles.
* BlackAnalysis function supports exportfiles with several conditions stored inside.


amsReliability v0.4 (Release date: 2015-10-14)
==============

Changes:

* MAN pages were adapted to code changes.
* Creation of exportfiles for MIRA is working.
* Creation of exportfile returns clear error messages to users if problems occur.


amsReliability v0.3 (Release date: 2015-10-12)
==============

Changes:

* fix 'Â°C' encoding bug
* Non linear least square modelization of experimental data is implemented.
* Only failed devices are taken into account in the modelization. Censored distribution are perfectly describded.
* Black parameters are automaticaly extracted from the dataset.
* Error band calculation is performed.


amsReliability v0.2 (Release date: 2015-10-08)
==============

Changes:

* MAN pages are available.
* A save option is available for storing the chart generated during the analysis.


amsReliability v0.1 (Release date: 2015-10-07)
==============

Changes:

* Initial release
* Creation of exportfile is supported for ACE equipment.
* BlackAnalysis allows to create a chart with the exportfiles present in a folder.
